# Idea for codefundo++

- What are we planning to build?
</br>We want to use drones to do terrain mapping, detection of count of humans after a flood or tsunami has occurred. We believe this would be helpful in having a quicker reponse during the aftermath of a calamity. This would also be helpful in efficient planning of the response. <br> 

- How does it work?
</br>We aim to use a swarm of UAVs(Unmanned Aerial Vehicle's) to navigate to areas where human response team cannot easily penetrate and use the onboard camera sensor to detect humans and then assess the situation accordingly and plan the response.<br>

- How users can get started with the project?
</br>a)Read about Project Kinect for Azure(https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/campaigns/kinect/).<br>
</br>b)Install Microsoft AirSim simulator (https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim).<br>

- What dataset(s) are we using?
</br>As of now, we have a plan to do the work in the Microsoft AirSim simulator and hence will not be using any dataset.<br>
- What technologies are we using?
</br> Project Kinect for Azure, Microsoft AirSim for Simulation.<br>
